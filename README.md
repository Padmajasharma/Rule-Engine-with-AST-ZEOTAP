# Rule Engine with AST

## Overview
This project implements a simple 3-tier rule engine application that determines user eligibility based on attributes like age, department, income, and experience. The engine uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent conditional rules, allowing for dynamic creation, combination, and modification of these rules.

## Features
- Define and evaluate complex eligibility rules.
- Dynamic creation and modification of rules using an AST.
- RESTful API to interact with the rule engine.

## Technologies
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB (with Mongoose)

## Data Structure
The core data structure for representing the AST is defined as follows:

```javascript
class Node {
    constructor(type, left = null, right = null, value = null) {
        this.type = type; // "operator" or "operand"
        this.left = left; // Reference to left child Node
        this.right = right; // Reference to right child Node (for operators)
        this.value = value; // Optional value for operand nodes (e.g., comparisons)
    }
}
```

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
- **MongoDB** (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)
- **Git**

### Clone the Repository
1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Padmajasharma/Rule-Engine-with-AST-ZEOTAP.git
   cd repositoryname
   ```

### Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ruleengine
```

Modify the `MONGO_URI` as needed based on your MongoDB setup.

### Running the Application
Start the application using:

```bash
node src/app.js
```

Or, if you have a start script defined in `package.json`:

```bash
npm start
```

### Docker Setup (Optional)
To run the application using Docker, create a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory. Example:

#### Dockerfile
```dockerfile
FROM node:14

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

#### docker-compose.yml
```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/ruleengine

  mongo:
    image: mongo
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
```

To start the application using Docker, run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## API Design
### Endpoints
1. **Create Rule**
   - `POST /api/rules`
   - Body: `{ "rule_string": "your_rule_string" }`
   - Returns: AST Node object representing the rule.

2. **Combine Rules**
   - `POST /api/rules/combine`
   - Body: `{ "rules": ["rule1", "rule2"] }`
   - Returns: Combined AST Node object.

3. **Evaluate Rule**
   - `POST /api/rules/evaluate`
   - Body: `{ "data": { "age": 35, "department": "Sales", "salary": 60000, "experience": 3 } }`
   - Returns: `true` or `false`.

## Testing
Run tests located in the `tests` directory:

```bash
npm test
```

## Design Choices
- **Modular Architecture**: The project follows a modular design for better maintainability and scalability.
- **AST Representation**: Using an AST allows for efficient evaluation and modification of rules.
- **Express Framework**: Chosen for its simplicity and flexibility in building APIs.
